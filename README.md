## ðŸŒ¨ A Weather App built using the OpenWeatherMap API


GA challenged us to build a small weather app, using our newfound skills with APIs, Javascript, HTML and CSS!

The weather App that i built will allow you to search by postcode or city name and will return the results. There is an option to set a default location which will store you query in local storage.

Thanks for visiting!
